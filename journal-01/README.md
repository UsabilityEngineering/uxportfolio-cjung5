  I would like to explain about an unsatisfactory ESC key of Macbook and it is uncomfortable to use it. Since I knew a defect of this product, it will be a good chance to tell about a problem of the product and effects of the design.
  
  This is a keyboard of Apple's Macbook. As you can see, the top place which is over number buttons is touch bar. Normal buttons work with pressing, but this touch bar works with touching. It seems to be the same, but there is a huge difference especially on __feedback__. Usually, a button comes back as the same place after the button was pressed and a user can know physically whether the user was pressed the button or not. Even if the user didn't see the button, the user can notice whether the button was pressed. However, the touch bar is dependent on the userâ€™s sight since buttons of the touch bar tell whether a button was pressed through changing colors of the button. This design has a lot of possibilities to exceed user's __error tolerance__ because most users don't see the keyboard when they are typing. To check the buttons of the touch bar are working correctly, users need to see the touch bar or wait until some changes have occurred in the display. Since the changes are shown on the display directly, it seems to be not important. However, users need to keep in mind checking that one of the buttons on the touch bar was worked when the button was touched. It can be making one more step to use the product. It is not __efficient__ and it will decrease the user's __satisfaction__.
  
  Apple's laptop is used by a lot of developers since the product allows to develop programs that are related to their products. To code programs, developers need to use terminals and they need to press the ESC key frequently. In many __senarios__, it will be a good method which is asking about __who is the users__ and __what is their tasks__.
  
  The touch bar shows well how Apple worked hard to show new technology. When they made this product, we can know that they concerned __object's affordance__ for users through the button's alignment. However, they overlooked one of the important things; __feedback__ for the user's __satisfaction__. Since most users didn't satisfy with this touch bar especially the ESC key, Apple recovered the ESC key with a physical button for their new product.
